#Two types of routing
-client side routing
-server side routing
🌐 Server-Side Routing (Traditional Way)
Imagine you're in a restaurant.

You: “I want About Us page.”
Waiter (Server): Goes to the kitchen (server), brings back a full new dish (HTML page).
Every time you ask for a new page, they go back and get a new one.

👉 In Tech Terms:
Every route (like /about) makes a request to the server.

The server responds with a full HTML page.

The page refreshes every time you navigate.
